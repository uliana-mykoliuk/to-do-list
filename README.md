- ✔️ Switching the status of a record Completed / Not completed when clicking on its name.
- ✔️ Filtering by type (all, completed, current).
- ✔️ Display counter of completed and uncompleted tasks.
- ✔️ Use a storage (Redux).
- ✔️ For styling, you can use any lib/framework, but remember UI matters.
- ✖️ Please use this linter [wemake-frontend-styleguide](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-frontend-styleguide).

## Additional Information:
If I had more time I would work on: 
- code refactoring (simplify redux), 
- fix sorting when drag item to another board
- add pagination - needed to real project
- add search by task text
...
There are place for a lot of improvements, I've done everything I could in my free time
